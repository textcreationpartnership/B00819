            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But that ye may be examples of the flocke; In Iurie the ſhepheards which led and fed any ſheepe, went before them, and their flocks alwaies followed after them, contrary to our common vſe and cuſtome.

               <hi>non corpore ſed animo, non via ſed vita, non exeundo ſed exemplo,</hi> that is, <hi>that they would ſhew themſelues patterns and preſidents, platformes and examples vnto the people in good life, godly manners, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous behauiour:</hi> which how neceſſarie and behoouefull it is,<note place="margin">Example to them that beleue in 6. things</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe ſignifieth, when as he chargeth <hi>Timothie</hi> to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that beleeue in ſix things. Firſt, in the word that is, in the doctrine of the Goſpel. Secondly, in conuerſation; that is, in keeping the ſame, and expreſſing the obedience thereof in all Chriſtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour. Thirdly, in loue, which ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what manner of conuerſation he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, euen all deeds of mercie &amp; works of charity which are contained vnder loue, which is the complement of the law, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:181128:19"/>the accompliſhment of the Goſpell; the olde commandement of the Lord God, and the newe commandement of Chriſt Ieſus; and containeth in it our two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall dueties both to God and man: vpon the which two things doe hang both the law and the prophets. Fourthly, in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; that is, in the gifts and graces, fruits and effects of the ſpirit, with which both preacher and people ought to be endued. Fiftly, in faith; that is, in ſtedfaſtly belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the truth of Gods word and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his promiſes, and in wholy relying vpon the mercies of God the Father, and the merits of Chriſt Ieſus his ſonne &amp; our Sauiour, the onely badge and cogniſance of true Chriſtians, who are onely thereby diſcerned from Turkes, Saracens, Moores, Indians, Barbarians, and Infidels whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer. Sixtly and laſtly, in puritie; which is the perfection of all religion, when as God is ſerued and feared in ſoundneſſe and ſinceritie, ſimplicitie and ſingleneſſe of heart, without all doubting, deceit and diſſembling, which may be as ſix rules of obſeruation and imitation included, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not expreſſed in theſe wordes of our Apoſtle. To the which if we adde a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:181128:20"/>ſeuenth particular vertue to make vp a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect number, which is humilitie, I hope we ſhal fully attaine to the meaning of the holy Ghoſt in this place: for that <hi>Peter</hi> here would eſpecially that they ſhould be types and mirrours of humilitie, it is as cleare as the noone-day by the former part of the <hi>Antitheſis</hi> or oppoſition in the words going before; for in ſteede of the lordly lowlineſſe which he wiſheth them to abhorre before, he commendeth vnto them lowly humilitie, as principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the ſame at their hands: and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth vnto them, that they ſhall not ſhew themſelues to be Lords ouer Gods heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, if they make themſelues examples of meeknes and mildnes, modeſtic and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration vnto their flocks.</p>
            <p>The like exhortation alſo doth <hi>Paul</hi> make to <hi>Titus,</hi> that aboue all things hee ſhew himſelfe an example of good works with vncorrupt doctrine, and this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, then particularly how with grauitie and integritie of life and with the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome word which cannot be reprooued. For doctrine, to what end or effect? euen twofolde, as a double fruit redounding from thence; as firſt to the ſhame &amp; blame
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:181128:20"/>of his aduerſaries and his own good name and fame, that they which withſtand may be aſhamed, hauing nothing concerning you to ſpeake euill of <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.7.8. Herein following the ſteps of our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, who before warned his Diſciples, and in them al the miniſters and preachers of the word of what degree or place ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that the light of their life doe ſhine forth before men, &amp;c. for theſe two ends, for the good of men, and the glorie of God; when he ſaith, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16.</p>
            <p>But more eſpecially to this particular vertue of humilitie, which our Apoſtle principally aimeth at in this place <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Learne of me, for I am meeke and lowly in heart,</hi> &amp;c. wiſhing them to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues examples of humilitie vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as he declared himſelfe a preſident of meekneſſe and lowlineſſe vnto them, and that in heart, and not in tongue; in deed, and not in word; in truth, and not in ſhew: for the learned miniſterie ought ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with their ſcience, that they correct their conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to an vpright conſcience, and ſo to frame and faſhion their whole life and manners, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Yea they ought to endeuour ſo to be endued with all the vertues of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, that if it were poſſible they might obtaine to his perfection, and attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the meaſure of his age and fulneſſe, as <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. that all their workes might be nothing els but oracles, and their workes miracles; that although they be men, yet they may liue as Angels; and albeit they haue their habitation here on earth, yet to haue their conuerſation in heauen; that they may be called Gods for practiſing the word, as they are tearmed Gods for preaching the Goſpell. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.35. <hi>For they being as Cities ſcituate vpon an hill, as our Sauiour, as watchmen placed in a tower, as Ezech and as candles ſet vpon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks, as Iohn in the Apocalip.</hi> ought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to ſhew themſelues as lights vnto the feete, and lanthornes vnto the pathes of the people, who are carried with full
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:181128:21"/>force and ſwift ſtreame, to follow the ſteps of their guides, and gouernours, for as it is in the Prouerb, <hi>Regis ad exemplum, &amp;c.

            <p>In which reſpect all miniſters and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ought carefully to looke vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they direct their waies accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods will and word, ſith their ſinnes are farre greater and more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, yea more hainous and horrible then the treſpaſſe of any other, being no ſingle ſolid ſinne; but double,<note place="margin">Sinne by example two folde.</note> and therefore dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and damnable. <hi>Nam bis peccat qui exemplo peccat:</hi> For ſinne by example is twofold: firſt, by ſinning himſelfe: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by cauſing others to fall, by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his folly.</p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:181128:24"/>as <hi>Iacob</hi> was a worldly; who in keeping and watching his flocke, was in the day conſumed with heate, and in the night with froſt; ſo that the ſleepe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from his eies <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.40. ſuch a carefull ſpirituall ſhepheard as <hi>Dauid</hi> was an earthly, who followed his Ewes great with young, feeding them according to the ſimplicitie of his heart, and guided them according to the diſcretion of his hands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.71.72. And finally ſuch a diligent eternall ſhepheard, as the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards of Bethlem were temporall ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, who abode ſtill in the fields, and kept watch by night, becauſe of their flocke, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.8. Such a painfull ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard as gathereth the Lambes with his arme, and carrieth them in his boſome, and guideth them that are with young, as <hi>Eſay,</hi> 40.11. ſaith. Such a tender-hearted ſhepheard, as whoſe bowels yearne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, when he ſeeth his ſheepe ſcattered or going aſtray, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.36. And ſuch a louing ſhepheard, as who (if that any of his ſheepe bee loſt and go aſtray) neuer ceaſeth ſeeking and following after it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he finde it: and when he hath found it, layeth it on his ſhoulders with ioy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioicing,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:181128:24"/>
               <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.4.5. But thirdly and principally is he called a ſhepheard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he laid downe his life for his ſheepe, preſeruing them with his owne pretious bloud, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.11. in which reſpect he is called the good ſhepheard in the ſame place, and the great ſhepheard of the ſheepe, and therefore great, becauſe of the bloud of the euerlaſting couenant which he ſhed for his ſheepe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. and the Prince that feedeth, or the princely ſhepheard of his people Iſrael, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. out of <hi>Miche.</hi> 5.2. as <hi>Homer</hi> calleth the Princes of Greece <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude, here called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Archſhepheard, as being the head and chiefe of the church, inſomuch that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miniſters, byſhops, and archbyſhops, of what degree or dignitie ſoeuer they be, are nothing els but ſubpaſtours and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhepheards vnto him. He being that hundred eied-ſhepheard <hi>Argus</hi> ſignified by the Poets, that was no idoll or idle ſhepheard, nor once ſleepie or ſlothfull, but alwaies watchfull and vigilant, being all eies and nothing but an eie to looke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his flocke. That wiſe Arcadian ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard <hi>Apollo Nomius,</hi> who for his feeding
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:181128:25"/>of ſheepe may well be called <hi>Nomius;</hi> ſo alſo for his excellencie aboue all others, as hauing no compeere or compagnion, may rightly bee tearmed <hi>Apollo,</hi> finally that great <hi>Pan</hi> and God of all ſhepheards, who hath put downe all other Gods and idoll ſhepheards, and is become himſelfe all in all.</p>
            <p>Exceeding therefore and intolerable is the pride and preſumption of the Pope and Biſhop of Rome, in taking vpon him, and calling himſelfe Vniuerſall Biſhop, head of the Church, and Lord of all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reauing and robbing Chriſt of his honor, wherein he ſheweth himſelfe to be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Antichriſt, a woolfe, an Hienna, an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite and hireling, a theefe and robber. But the vſe hereof vnto vs to apply it to our ſelues is twofold, both which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour teacheth and telleth vs himſelfe; that if he be our Shepheard &amp; our chiefe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, that firſt wee ought to heare his voice, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.3. that is, not to heare it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the outward eares of our body, but with the inward eares of our ſoules; but alſo to beleeue it faithfully in our harts to keepe it obediently in the actions of our life and conuerſation, and to beare
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:181128:25"/>fruit, and to bring foorth with Patience, ſome thirtie, ſome ſixtie, &amp;c. For, <hi>not the hearers of the lawe, but the doers, &amp;c. Iames. And bleſſed are they that heare the word of God and keepe it, Luk.</hi> 11. And finally, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer heareth my word and doth the ſame, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 7. And againe, his voice and not the voice of any ſtranger nor of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not the voice of any riſen againe from the dead, nor of any Angell comming from heauen, that is only the truth of his word and Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that we ought to follow him as he is our <hi>Shepheard, Ioh.</hi> 10.4. and to flie from a ſtranger or any other whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer which is not a follower of him, and how to follow him, euen in all his vertues; as firſt in his humilitie as he commandeth vs himſelfe, <hi>Learne of me, for I am meeke, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 11. the place mentioned before, and euen ſo to humble and ſubmit our ſelues one vnto another, as if occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to doe the moſt baſe dueties and ſeruices that can be each to other, as he himſelfe did when he waſhed his Diſciples feete, and enioyned them to doe the like; <hi>Saying, Ioh.</hi> 13.14.15. <hi>If I, then your Lord and Maſter haue waſhed your feete, ye ought
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:181128:26"/>alſo to waſh one anothers feete, for I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen you an example that ye ſhould doe euen as I haue done to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in ſuffering aduerſitie, and bearing the croſſe as he himſelfe likewiſe warneth vs in the Goſpell: Saying, <hi>He that will be my diſciple, let him take vp his croſſe and follow me;</hi> To which alſo <hi>Peter</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs, ſaying: <hi>For Chriſt alſo ſuffered for vs, leauing vs an example that we ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his ſteps,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.</p>
            <p>Thirdly in loue, as he himſelfe likewiſe requireth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.12. <hi>This is my comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that ye loue one another as I haue loued you.</hi> Finally, leaſt I dwell too long in this point, in all the workes of charitie, in all the deeds of mercie, in all the fruits of the ſpirit, that we may be holy as he is holy, righteous as he is righteous, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as he is perfect, although not <hi>aequaliter</hi> as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as farre foorth as lieth in vs, that we may grow vp to a perfect man, euen vnto the meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. And thus much of the perſon of the chiefe Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard.</p>
            <p>Now of the time when he will beſtow,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:181128:26"/>and we ſhall receiue the reward mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the words following; that is, when hee ſhall appeare. There are two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings or appearings of this chiefe Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard. The firſt in humilitie, the ſecond in maieſtie: the firſt in pouertie, the ſecond power: the firſt grace, the ſecond glorie: firſt to be iudged, ſecondly to iudge: the firſt to die, the ſecond to reſtore life; the firſt is gone and paſt, the ſecond is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and approacheth, of which our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in this place and not of the other. Which ſecond comming is called by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and ſundrie names in the Scripture, according to the diuers and ſundry effects and fruits, benefits and bleſſings, which we ſhall reape and receiue thereby. As ſometimes it is called the kingdome of God, as <hi>Luke</hi> 17.20. becauſe then the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, heauenly, and euerlaſting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhall be reſtored to Iſrael, when as our Sauiour ſhall ſhew himſelfe to be the king of heauen and earth, and ſhall haue an Archangell ſounding a trumpet before him as his herauld, or harbinger: and the reſt of the Angels, euen <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as the author to the <hi>Heb.</hi> an whole troupe of heauenly ſouldiers which ſhall attend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:181128:27"/>him as his guard, when as he ſhal make all the elect and faithfull his ſubiects, and admit them free-denizens and fellowe citizens with the Saints; yea when as they ſhall as heires and heires annexed with Chriſt, poſſeſſe, inherite and enioy that kingdome which God the Father prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and gaue vnto them; God the Sonne purchaſed and appointed vnto them; and into the which, God the holy Ghoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded and enrowled them. which king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath theſe foure ſurpaſſing priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and prerogatiues, beſides many other liberties, immunities and franchiſes, euen thoſe foure laſt articles of our creed. Firſt, the communion of Saints: ſecondly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes: thirdly, reſurrection of the body; and fourthly, life euerlaſting. <hi>Cuius pax charitas, lex veritas, modus aeterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin: the peace whereof is nothing but charitie, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it is called <hi>the day of Chriſts comming, Mat.</hi> 24. and <hi>Luke</hi> 17. becauſe that then our Sauiour ſhall not only be with vs in ſpiritual preſence &amp; preſidence, as hitherto be hath beene ſince the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of him ſelfe, and the deſcenſion of the holy Ghoſt, but ſhall come both in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:181128:27"/>and ſpirit, both in bodie &amp; ſoule, both in his humanitie and in his diuinitie: of which comming of his, <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>Veniet tanquam rex glorioſus è Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio tanquam ſponſus ſpecioſus èthalamo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the great day in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Scriptures: great in reſpect of the greatneſſe of our Sauiour that then commeth, the great King of glorie, the great Lord of heauen and earth: againe, great in regarde of the great thinges that ſhall be done that day; and finally, great of it ſelfe, greater then any of the feaſts of the Iewes, then the feaſts of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, Penticoſt or Eaſter, which were but ſhadowes and ſignifications of this great day; Yea greater then the great high and ſolemne holy daies of Chriſtians; greater then the day of the Incarnation, Paſſion, or Reſurrection of our Sauiour.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the latter day oftentimes in the Goſpel wherein we muſt take our dernier adewe, after which there ſhall be no other day, which ſhall be neither artificiall day, nor naturall day, but an eternal day: a day without night, wherein ſhall be a light without darkneſſe, wherein ſhall neither Sunne ſhine nor Moone giue light, nor
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:181128:28"/>ſtarre appeare, but only the brightneſſe of the glorie of God the laſt Sabaoth of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoths; the day of that euerlaſting Iubile wherein all men ſhall reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, receaue continuall quiet, and liue in perpetuall peace for euer and euer.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the time of cooling or refreſhing, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Acts,</hi> 3.19. wherein after we haue ſweat and ſwounke in this toile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and troubleſome world, and beene ſcorched in the purgatorie of this life in the parching heate of perſecution, we ſhal be cooled and comforted, refreſhed and reuiued againe; not only with the freſh &amp; holeſome ayrie wind of the holy Ghoſt, but with the ſweete ſpringing water of the mercie of God: with which not only the tips of our tongues ſhall be cooled, which was all that Hel-burnt <hi>Diues</hi> did deſire, but our whole bodies and ſoules ſhall be ſprinckled with.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.5. the day of wrath and of the declaration or reuelation of the iuſt iudgement of God.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:181128:28"/>effects of his furious affection of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vpon them, when as he ſhall ſhewe himſelfe to be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> harde and auſtere, as the ſlothfull ſeruant ſaid of him, euen a ſeuere iudge and a conſuming fire, as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.20. out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.24. whoſe fierie wrath ſo hoatly inflamed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them they ſhall not be able then to quench, no not with ſtreames of drerie teares and flouds of bitter flittings. And <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the day of the Reuelation of the iuſt iudgement of God, becauſe that then our Sauiour will declare and reueile himſelfe to be the Iudge of the world, to giue dome and definitiue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence both of quicke and dead, and that as it were in open court of generall Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or aſſiſes, when as he ſhall render to euerie man according to his workes; ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance vpon the wicked, and reward vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the righteous, deſtruction and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto the vngodly, but ſoules health and ſaluation vnto the Godly.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the day of the Epiphanie, not the firſt Epiphanie when Chriſts birth was manifeſted to the wiſe men of the Eaſt, by the leading of a ſtarre: but when Chriſts glorie ſhall be reueiled
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:181128:29"/>by the finall eclipſe of the ſunne, the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the moone, the falling of the ſtars, and the ſhaking of the powers of heauen: when as the ſonne of man ſhall ſo come as the lightning commeth out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth vnto the Weſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.27. and 29. when as the hearts of all men ſhal be made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Eightly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the day of viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when as Chriſt Ieſus the great biſhop of our ſoules ſhall viſit the ample dioceſſe of his Church, and ſhall call all the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie before him and cauſe them to render account of their cures and charges, and ſhall make thoſe ſhine as ſtarres for euer and euer, that ſhal winne ſoules vnto God, but will remoue thoſe candles out of their candleſtickes, or els the candleſtickes out of their places, which either giue no light or bad light, or are either dropping can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles by their lewd &amp; lothſome life, or ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting candles by their troubleſome and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious doctrine.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, the day of appearing as in this place, becauſe that then our Sauiour the ſunne of Righteouſneſſe ſhall ſodenly pearſe the cloudes and breake fourth in glorious brightneſſe, by the ſhining
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:181128:29"/>beames of his heauenly grace; fulfilling the heartes of all the faithfull, with the cheerefull light and comfortable heate of his diuine preſence, which haue lien long as it were in <hi>Ioſephs</hi> colde yrons of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie and affliction, and languiſhed in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> darke dungeon of deſpaire. As the naturall ſunne with his gladſome glee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the diſmall darkeneſſe of the wearie night, diſpelleth and diſpierceth the thicke clouds being long looked and longed for, at the laſt appeareth to the chearing and cheriſhing of all mankind: ſo called an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to the comfort and conſolation of the good &amp; the godly, that when they ſee the leaſt glimpſe and glimmering of him to peepe out or appeare, they ſhould then lift vp their heads and looke vp, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their redemption is at hand: for then, and neuer till then ſhall the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man receiue his wages, the labourer in the Lords vineyard his pennie, the faithfull ſeruant the rule of the Lords houſe, the thriftie vſer of his talents, the gouernment of ſo many Cities, the conſtant runner his propounded garland, the ſpirituall ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er his promiſed crowne, the little flocke their prepared kingdome, the followers of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:181128:30"/>Chriſt in their regeneration, their thrones of iudgement. Which time teacheth vs that we ſhould not ſo doate as to dreame of any crowne, throne or kingdome in this life, or once to looke for any paradiſe, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or other bleſſedneſſe in this world, nor any time to hope for any happineſſe before our chiefe ſhepheard doe appeare. For as there is no heauenly paradiſe but in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, nor any pleaſures for euermore but at the right hand of God, nor any true ioies to be found, but in the kingdome of heauen: ſo are we not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into this paradiſe to enioy theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and to be partakers of theſe ioies, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the day of his appearing.</p>
            <p>In the meane time therefore, we muſt not with the husbandman looke to reape with ioy, before we haue ſown with tears; nor to looke to liue with him, before we haue died with him: to raigne with him before we haue ſuffered with him: to be gloriſied with him, before we haue beene crucified with him: to ſit with him on his right hand and on his left, before we haue drunck of the cuppe that he hath druncke of, and been baptized with the baptiſme that he hath been baptized with: to bee

Finally, not to ſit on his throne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we haue continued with him in his temptations. For firſt muſt the Church be militant here vpon earth, before it can be triumphant in heauen; firſt muſt we ſuffer affliction, before we can liue Godly in Chriſt Ieſus: and to conclude, firſt muſt we be in tribulation, before we can enter into the kingdome of heauen.

               <p>Now come we to the reward which our Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> promiſeth in the perſon of our Sauiour Chriſt, which is no light thing of ſmall valew, or meane account; but the greateſt gifte and richeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that can be giuen and receiued; a bountie beſeeming the perſon of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour the beſtower, and worthy the partie that is partaker.

But our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle goeth farre beyond the philoſopher in promiſing a bleſſedneſſe to the elect and the faithfull, which farre ſurmounteth this Ethick and Ethnicke happines, not a gift of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:181128:35"/>honour, but a guerdon of glorie; that as the giuer thereof is called the king of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the place where this ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed is tearmed the kingdome of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and as his ſpouſe is alſo glorious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and as his Angels in heauen ſing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but glorie to God on high, and and his Saints on earth; but glorie be to the Father and to the Sonne, &amp;c. and as nothing but glorious things are ſpoken of his Citie, ſo he giueth nothing els but a a crowne of glorie.</p>
               <p>We reade of Princely crownes, Royall crownes, Imperiall crownes, and we heare of the Popes Triple crowne, and all theſe for matter and mettall of fine pure golde, for forme and faſhion moſt curiouſly wrought, according to the skill and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Artificer, polliſhed and garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with flower-deluces, and pomgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, with other varieties embeliſhed and enameled with moſt flouriſhing and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent colours, beautified and beſet with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones and pearles of great price. But none of all theſe is like to this crowne of glorie, which he hath prepared for the elect. For if the ſtreets of the Citie of God be of pure golde and ſhining chriſtall, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:181128:35"/>the walles of the ſame of precious ſtones, and the gates thereof of pearles, whatſhal the crowne belonging to this kingdome be? who is able to expreſſe the glorie of it, or to what glorious thing in the world may it be compared?

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:181128:36"/>for euer and euer. Not to ſpeake of other crownes not found in the Scriptures, but in the Fathers, as of the crowne of virgins, the crowne of Doctours, the crowne of Martyrs, and the triple crowne which <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> mentioneth in his 243.

We leaue therfore this Adiunct and come to the next, which is, that this is not onely a crowne, but alſo an incorruptible crowne.</p>
               <p>Our Apoſtle hauing vſed here in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which he promiſeth and propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a metaphore or borrowed ſpeech ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from wraſtlers and champions, from their manner of crowning after they haue lawfully ſtriuen, and vanquiſhed; nowe notwithſtanding he ſeemeth to ſhew a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in this word betweene this crowne and their crowne, in that this is incourrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, but theirs to be ſubiect to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, notably amplifying the excellencie of the reward. Likewiſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:181128:36"/>doth the like, but more fully following this Metaphore, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.25. <hi>Euerie man that trieth maiſtries abſtaineth from althings and they doe it to obtaine a corruptible crown, but we for an incorruptible crowne.</hi> The word which our Apoſtle vſeth in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall is verie ſignificant <gap reason="foreign">

For what is there in the world ſo ſound and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall that is not tranſitorie and ſubiect to corruption? Gold the moſt ſolid mettall of all others, yet in time it weareth away. The Adamant though otherwiſe not to be broken, by Goates bloud mouldreth in pieces.

Let vs therefore laie vp onely this treaſure in heauen, ayme onely at this crowne, ſeeke onely this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, labour onely to reape and receiue this reward: for this treaſure is onely ſure, this pleaſure onely ſincere, this reward onely remaining, this crowne onely incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; finally this glorie onely euerlaſting. <hi>Tigranes</hi> king of Armenia ſaid of his roial golden crowne (conſidering the heauie burden of his chargeable gouernment) that to weare and beare a crowne, was not ſo happie as honourable, nay ſo honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as hard; and that therefore if it were to take againe, he would not vouchaſafe to ſtoupe for it, if he found it lying on the ground.</p>

               <p>But this Crowne of which our Apoſtle ſpeaketh, and the chiefe ſhepheard giueth, cannot be tearmed hard, becauſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour often offereth and profereth the ſame, now doth promiſe, and hereafter will performe it vnto vs; and yet withall, honourable, for it is a crowne of glorie; yea and happy too, becauſe it maketh vs happy and bleſſed; yea and euerlaſting happy, becauſe it is an incorruptible crowne; and that therefore all men of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre degree, ſtate, and condition, young and olde, rith and poore, high and lowe, euen Potentates and Princes, Kings and Keyſars, Monarchs and conquerors ought not onely to ſtoupe for it, but to beſtirre themſelues and endeuour with all might and maine, and all meanes poſſible, yea with all the outward parts of their bodies, and inward powers of their minde to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it.</p>

               <p>But as for that other euill and ſlothfull ſeruant, which had but one talent, who wrapt it vp in a napkin, &amp; went and hid it in the earth, accuſing his maſters hardnes:

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:181128:63"/>is ſo tearmed it appeareth, being the ſpirit of God himſelfe, which cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be named without this title of holineſſe, this being the proper attribute thereof; as it is euident euerie where in the goſpell, when as it is not onely holy in it ſelfe, and of it ſelfe, but alſo holy by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king others holy; both holy in cauſe, and holy in effect; holy by his owne inſtinct, and holy by inſpiring others. But now of which of all theſe, which haue the name and title of holineſſe, doth <hi>Iohn</hi> here ſay, that theſe babes had receiued the foreſaid ointment? Certaine it is, that hereby can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant any of the firſt ſort of holy things, or holy men, which are but in the lower degree of holineſſe, and which draw and deriue all the holines they haue from the other, as being the welſpring &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Holineſſe. For none of theſe are ſo good and gracious, as to purchaſe and procure ſo great &amp; glorious an ointment, or of ſuch woorth and worthineſſe, as to giue and beſtow ſo high and heauenly a thing, which is farre better and more bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed then themſelues, no not the Apoſtles themſelues, although they were the moſt holy of all other, next vnto our Sauiour
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:181128:63"/>Chriſt himſelfe, were not able to giue the ſame. For although <hi>Symon Magus</hi> ſeeme to aske the holy ghoſt euen this ointment at the hands of the Apoſtles, as though it were in their power to giue the ſame; Yet it is otherwiſe, if we marke the words of the Scriptures; that is, that <hi>Symon Magus</hi> onely offered them money, on condition that they would giue him alſo the ſame power, which they had themſelues, that vpon whomſoeuer he might lay hands, he might receiue the holy ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.19. As <hi>Aug.</hi> himſelfe hath verie well noted, there being no mention of giuing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of receiuing the holy ghoſt, <hi>De Trinit. lib.</hi> 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. He that gaue this ointment muſt needs be one of the three moſt holy perſons in the Trinitie, either God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or God the Sonne, or God the holy ghoſt. And yet can it not be ſaid, that any one of theſe doth alone giue it, becauſe it is indeed the common gift of them all; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that olde Scholaſticall rule of diuinitie ſound enough.<note place="margin">A rule in Diuinitie.</note> 
                  <hi>Omnia opera Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis ad extra ſunt communia,</hi> and moſt certaine it is, that as the holy ghoſt in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence proceedeth both from the Father &amp; the Sonne, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> euidently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:181128:64"/>in his Creed;<note place="margin">Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Creed.</note> ſo the ſame holy ghoſt in effect: for the gifts and graces thereof, are conferred &amp; beſtowed to the publike profit of the whole Church, and to the priuate vſe of ſome ſpeciall children of God, by all the three perſons in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for ſo <hi>Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4.5.6. Now there are diuerſities of gifts, but the ſame ſpirit. And there are diuerſities of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, but the ſame Lord. And there are diuerſities of operations, but God is the ſame, which worketh all in all. Albeit, becauſe here is one eſpecially pointed at, we muſt finde out which of the three he ſhould be, that gaue this ointment vnto them, and which is here more eſpecially ſaid to be holy. Firſt, although it may be ſaid to be God the Father, becauſe <hi>euerie good and perfect gift commeth downe from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue from the Father of lights,</hi> as <hi>Iames,</hi> 1.17. <hi>Or that he is the holy one of Iſrael,</hi> as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> 1.4. Or againe, to be the holy ghoſt, becauſe this ointment may ſeeme to be a gift of the ſpirit, and for that moſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is called the holy ghoſt. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, if we marke the circumſtances of the text, the purpoſe of the Apoſtle, and the drift and intendiment of the doctrine
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:181128:64"/>of the whole Epiſtle, the ſcope thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing els but this, euen to prooue Ieſus to be Chriſt againſt <hi>Ebion, Cerinthus, Marcion</hi> and <hi>Carpocrates,</hi> with their ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, which were the Heretikes, Sciſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and Antichriſts of this time. The ſame point which <hi>Iohn</hi> aymeth at, both in his goſpell, and in his Reuelation, as it may more euidently appeare by the 22. v. of this Chap. Againe it is manifeſt by the coherence of the wordes, that by him in this place he meaneth none other but him,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 11.7.2.1.2.</note> whom in the 1. chap. 1. he calleth <hi>the word of life,</hi> and affirmeth <hi>to be the purgation of our ſinnes,</hi> verſe, 2. at whom he eſpecially driueth, from whom he draweth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riueth the whole tenour of his exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on following vnto this my text, and ſo forth to the end both of the Chapter and the Epiſtle: beſides it cannot ſo conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be vnderſtood of God the Father, for that the giuing of the holy ghoſt is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſeldome or neuer aſcribed vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the Scriptures, nor of the holy Ghoſt; for that the holy Ghoſt cannot fitly be ſaid to giue it ſelfe this ointment, being as it is already declared, no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar gift or grace, fruit or effect thereof, but
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:181128:65"/>the verie ſpirite of God it ſelfe, which in the 27. verſe, is ſaid by the Apoſtle to dwel in them. And <hi>Auſt.</hi> himſelfe putteth this matter out of doubt, when he ſaith, <hi>Qui promiſit, miſit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt therefore to declare the cauſe, that Chriſt did certainly promiſe and faithfully perfourme, in ſending afterwards the holy ghoſt, and did oftentimes giue the ſame vnto his Diſciples and others, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing almoſt more common in the goſpel; As in <hi>Iohn,</hi> 14.16.26. the 15.26. and the 16.7. and in manie other places which were too long to rehearſe. Where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſometimes God the Father is ſaid to ſend and giue the comforter; yet muſt we remember withal, that it is in the name and by the means and mediation of Chriſt alone. And therefore the Baptiſt likewiſe promiſed the ſame in Chriſts name, ſaying, that <hi>he ſhould baptize with the holy ghoſt, and with fire, Mat.</hi> 3.11. at the firſt comming of Chriſt. As our Sauiour alſo doth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his owne perſon, when he ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall be baptized with the holy Ghoſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few daies, Act.</hi> 1.5. And this for his promiſe, now that he did likewiſe ſend the holy ghoſt accordingly, it appeareth <hi>Act.</hi> 2
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:181128:65"/>when as vpon this day of Pentecoſt, hee ſent the holy ghoſt in ſenſible and viſible forme of firie clouen tongues, ver. 3. And that he gaue the holy ghoſt oftentimes, both before and after, it is manifeſt: As firſt, when hee endued his 12. Diſciples with the holy ghoſt, and conſecrated them his 12. Apoſtles; when as he firſt ſent them forth by commiſſion, to preach vnto the Iewes only, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. Againe, beſtowing the ſame ſpirit on the 70. diſciples his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners, which he ſent likewiſe to preach by two and by two, when he gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them power to treade on Serpents and Scorpions, and ouer all the power of the enemie, and that nothing ſhould hurt them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when he breathed the Holy ghoſt into his Diſciples, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them by a ſecond commiſſion to go and preach vnto all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, &amp;c. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 20.22. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. And afterwards, when he repleniſhed the 7. Deacons, <hi>Stephen, Philip,</hi> &amp;c. and alſo <hi>Paul, Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> with diuers others, with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt, as we may reade euerie where in the <hi>Acts.</hi> Now that he moſt properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:181128:66"/>to be called holy, it is euident, not onely by that which is already ſaid in this behalfe, but alſo ſhewing himſelfe ſo to be in all reſpects; not only as he was God, but alſo as he was man, holy in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; for he was conceiued by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt, &amp; ouerſhadowed with the power of the moſt higheſt. Holy in his birth without corruption, and holy in his death without deſtruction; holy in his tentation, wherein hee was victorious; holy in his transfiguration, wherein he was glorious; holy in his words, which were diuine ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and holy in his workes, which were heauenly miracles; holy in his prayers, which were feruent and faithfull; holy in his preachings, for they were earneſt and powerfull; holy in all his afflictions, for they were pure; holy in all his actions, for they were perfect. Finally, holy in all his goings out and comming in. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without all queſtion, he only is the perſon who is here ſaid of <hi>Iohn to be Holy,</hi> and of whom, they to whom he writeth, receiued the foreſaid ointment. Now for the vſe of this vnto our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for thoſe that haue already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the holy ghoſt, or any gift, grace, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:181128:66"/>fruit thereof, they muſt not bragge, boaſt or be bolde thereof, as ſo to preſume of their owne worthineſſe, as though they had obtained it by their owne merit, when as they can neither poſſibly procure it of themſelues, nor purchaſe it by any means; for euerie good and perfect gift commeth downe from aboue from the Father of Lights, <hi>Iames,</hi> 1.17. Chriſt Ieſus, being the onely beſtower of this ointment, from whom it proceedeth, who hath promiſed it, and who hath prepared it for all thoſe that are able and capable of ſuch a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and therefore let them remember what the Apoſtle ſaith, to plucke downe the Peacocks feathers of all prowd preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, which are carried away with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerweening conceit of their own endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. What haſt thou, that thou haſt not receiued? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for thoſe that haue not at all this ointment, but want as yet ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie graces as are meete for their calling, let them hold vp holy hands, and lift vp holy hearts vnto him that is holy, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the Lords holy Sabaoth day in Gods holy houſe, and by holy prayer to aske this holy ointment, and endeuour to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:181128:67"/>be holy as he is holy, and to ſerue the Lord in holineſſe all the daies of their life, and they ſhall certainly bee endued with the holy ghoſt and heauenly ſpirit of God, and ſhall fully be repleniſhed with al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements conuenient for their vocation, according to that promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. That the holy ghoſt ſhall be giuen them that deſire him, we muſt not then aske this ointment, that is the Holy ghoſt; neither of the Pope as the Catholikes do, who chalengeth arrogantly and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly vnto himſelfe, to haue authoritie to giue the ſame, with all the gifts thereof; and therefore weareth a girdle about him, hauing ſeuen keies, with ſeuen ſeales han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thereupon, according to the ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold grace of the holy ghoſt, of binding, looſing, ſhutting, opening, ſealing, reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and iudging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paſcall</hi> the ſecond, Byſhop of Rome ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>Hildibrand,</hi> and more hautie then he, being the firſt that tooke vnto him this girdle of vanitie, contrarie to the Apoſtles girdle of veritie, putting it vpon him as an ornament of his holineſſe, or rather as a monument of his blaſphemie, and as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſance of his heauenly power, or as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:181128:67"/>a reſemblance of his helliſh pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. Nor of <hi>Symon Magus,</hi> as his ſectaries, the horrible Heretikes, the Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians did, who tearmed him &amp; his ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet <hi>Selene</hi> the holy ghoſt, as the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes called him the great power of God, <hi>Acts,</hi> 8.10. Nor of the Apoſtles as <hi>Symon Magus</hi> himſelfe did, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.19. becauſe it is not in their power, nor of any other Saint or Sorcerer, holy or vnholy, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heretike or Antichriſt whatſoeuer. But of him which is here ſaid to be eſpecially holy, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in way of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie and excellencie aboue all other, who onely giueth it, and in whoſe name, and for whoſe ſake it is onely giuen. And thus much and no more would I ſpeake of theſe words, &amp; ſo finiſh this firſt principal part of my text; but that our aduerſaries the Papiſts, who abſurdly abuſe this place,<note place="margin">Catholiks.</note> as they do many other; wreſting it to their Hypocriticall purpoſe, and forcing it to ſtabliſh their Hereticall doctrine, doe vrge me to contend with them in a matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to manifeſt truth. Seing that they are not aſhamed corruptly to depraue theſe words, in confirmation of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Sacrament of extreame vnction, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:181128:68"/>applying them vnto themſelues groſſely after this manner:<note place="margin">The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh forged Sacrament of extream vnction.</note> That by this ointment, the Apoſtle here meaneth nothing els but extreame vnction, and that it onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth vnto them, becauſe they are Catholike, and that they haue the ſame (as the Apoſtle ſaith) from him that is holy; that is, from their holy father the Pope and Byſhop of Rome.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore of their vnction, what affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie it hath with this our ointment. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, how fitly they may be called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, as <hi>Iohn</hi> tearmeth this his Epiſtle <hi>Catholike.</hi> And thirdly, what agreement there is betweene him that is here called holy, and their holy, or rather vnholy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope. For the firſt, their extreame vnction, the Catholikes deſcribe the ſame after this manner:<note place="margin">The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> As for matter to conſiſt of oyle oliue conſecrated by a Byſhop, the vſe thereof to anoile the ſicke aboue and beneath, forward and backward, vpon the eies, eares, mouth, noſe, hands and feete; a man vpon the reines of the backe, and a woman vpon the belly; filthy to ſpeake of vs, and more filthy to be done of them; becauſe ſay they, concupiſcence raigneth moſt in thoſe parts.<note place="margin">The forme</note> For forme, the words

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances &amp; ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies therof.</note> The miniſter thereof ſent for by the patient, who muſt firſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed of his mortall ſinnes and receiue ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, &amp; then humbly deſire for Gods ſake this extreame vnction. And if hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the party want any of the fore-named members, then muſt the next adioyning parts vnto the ſame be anoiled: for this reaſon as they alleadge, becauſe they haue thoſe members grounded in the ſoule. But with this double caueat. Firſt, that the perſons that are capable of this vnction, muſt be men and women, which haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, diſcretion and deuotion to require and requeſt the ſame, and not babes or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; and thoſe, ſuch as lie in perill of death by Gods viſitation, and not by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:181128:69"/>of warre, or at the time of execution. This <hi>Laurence <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aux,</hi> that compendious compiler in Engliſh, of Catholike Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſmes. But <hi>Kamniſius</hi> that Canon of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, and pillar of Poperie, in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme firſt ſaith as concerning this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; that we muſt beleeue whatſoeuer the Catholike Church hath conſtantly taught. Then he defineth the ſame after this manner: To be an holy ſigne inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in conſecrated oyle, as whereby, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly vertue is applyed to the ſicke for the health, not onely of the ſoule, but alſo of the body by diuine inſtitution. I come as neere his owne words as I can, And goeth further in bringing in the teſtimonie of of <hi>Iames</hi> the Apoſtle in confirmation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Chap. 5.14. <hi>Is any ſicke among you? Let him call vpon the Elders of the Church, and let them pray for him, and annoint him with oyle in the name of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. This as a precept, and withall, alleadging the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Apoſtles for practiſe thereof, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.13. that they annointed many that were ſick with oyle, and healed them. And the Tridentine Councell denounceth a fourefold <hi>Anathema,</hi> or bitter curſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all thoſe that ſhall not acknowledge
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:181128:69"/>and accept the foreſaid extreame vnction as a Sacrament, with all the ceremonies belonging thereunto before mentioned. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the great Champion of Rome, and refiner of many groſſe errours of other droſſie Papiſts, although he ſeeme not in euerie reſpect to admit the former doctrine, but maketh exception of that place of <hi>Marke,</hi> as that the oyle there, not to be the verie Sacrament of vnction, but onely a figure, ſhadowing, and inſinuation of the ſame. Herein warring and iarring from the reſt of his fellowes, in this anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto his name: yet in effect doth he conclude and confirme that which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid before. All which let vs conſider, and compare the oyle of <hi>Iames</hi> with the ointment of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Apoſtles an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing with the Prieſts anoiling. Theirs, a materiall oyle of oliues; ours, the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ointment of the holy Ghoſt; theirs, hallowed by a Romiſh Byſhop; ours, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the great Byſhop of our ſoules, Chriſt Ieſus: theirs, outwardly anoiling the bodie; ours, inwardly annointing the ſoul; theirs, againſt corporall diſeaſes; ours, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſpirituall ſickneſſes; theirs, at the perill and point of death; ours, at all times
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:181128:70"/>and ſeaſons; theirs, muſt needs haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion going before; ours, faith the onely meanes to obtaine the ſame; and theirs, not for infants in any wiſe; ours for babes, for ſo our Apoſtle calleth theſe that are here ſaid to haue this ointment.</p>
               <p>Now to trie their extreame vnction, how it is allowable by the touchſtone of the word of God, and agreeable to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie of faith,<note place="margin">Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes high traitors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God</note> firſt in making it a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Firſt we accuſe them of high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the diuine maieſtie of God, for forging this and other ſacraments &amp; ſeales, when as he himſelfe hath ordained and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed but two only, as his Petty or Priuy ſeale of Baptiſme, and his great or broad ſeale of Euchariſt; for which, they may truely be tearmed Sacramentaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as they falſely call vs. Secondly, in the matter and element thereof, they ſhew themſelues abſurd, when as they ſay that a Byſhop muſt needs conſecrate the ſame, when as they make any common hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt among them, ſufficient to conſecrate the greateſt Sacrament of all other, as they will not denie of the Lords ſupper by vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring onely theſe words; <hi>Hoc eſt corpus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> which they therefore call the words of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:181128:70"/>conſecration. Thirdly, in the vſe ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and filthie, in anoiling a woman on the belly, no holy action but an vnſeemely geſture, not to be named with pure lippes, nor to be heard with chaſt eares, for the forme without forme, the words of the Prieſt, not the written word of God, when as in euerie Sacrament the word ought to be added to the element.

                  <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur verbum ad elementum &amp; fit Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum.</hi> Fourthly, for the effect which they make double, both voide and vaine; the firſt for healing of the ſickneſſes, which neuer happeneth; the ſecond for remiſſion of ſins, which is friuolous in two reſpects. Firſt, becauſe this is the effect of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; and ſecondly, becauſe it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately followeth the abſolution, &amp; therfore altogither needleſſe. Laſtly, for all the reſt of the circumſtances and ceremonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereunto, being altogither fond and fooliſh; and the reaſons thereof are rude and ridiculous, for the annointing of ſo many and outward members, or thoſe adioyning vnto them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a Sacrament as they cannot but confeſſe, concerneth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſoule and the powers thereof, then the bodie, and the parts thereof, for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:181128:71"/>alwaies to require it of neceſſitie which oftentimes cannot be, when as ſick perſons moſt commonly lie ſpeechleſſe at the point of death.</p>
               <p>And againe, in depriuing thoſe of the benefit of this their Sacrament, which ſeeme to haue moſt need thereof: As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactours that are put to execution, and ſouldiers that die in warres, when as the Sacraments ought to bee common to all that are capable thereof, for thoſe places of Scripture which they alleadge for the foundation and confirmation thereof. As firſt for that of <hi>Marke,</hi> although herein they diſcent among themſelues, ſome of them leauing this holde, as taking it to be weake for their defence, as the Tridentine Councell; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others, who ſeeth not that the example of the Apoſtles maketh little for their purpoſe, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither extraordinarie and miraculous, being an eſpeciall and peculiar preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue power giuen vnto them, for the time of their firſt receiuiug of the Goſpell, that by ſuch workes of wonder the ſimplicitie of the word ſhould be eſtabliſhed by ſigns following, as it is <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.26. when if we ſhould for their healing of the ſicke,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:181128:71"/>attribute that to the vertue of the oyle which is to be aſcribed to the grace of the ſpirit of God, and gift of the holy Ghoſt, granted vnto them by Chriſt himſelfe. To adde authoritie vnto this calling, his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſhould rather be called Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries then Apoſtles, and this oyle to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted not a Sacrament but a medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and rather an impediment then an Adiument to their miracles, which facultie by that manner and meanes to cure diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, our Sauiour did not vouchſafe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe vpon the poſteritie of theſe primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue pillours of the Church, by any heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie right and ordinarie cuſtome, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a ſeaſon made it to be a ſeale vnto the Goſpell then preached.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:181128:72"/>power too too ſimply making that a Sacrament, which offereth vnto vs no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing ſignified, which our faith ſhould apprehend; but onely that which was forthwith effected, euen an healing, when as by as good reaſon, &amp; for as good cauſe, they might make the clay made of duſt and ſpittle by our Sauiour, wherewith he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him that was borne blinde.

But this their Apiſh imitation of the Apoſtles, cannot bring in vre againe that heauenly operation, which ceaſed 1500. yeares ago.<note place="margin">Iames. 5.15.</note> And beſides, it is manifeſt (if we mark the words of <hi>Iames</hi>) that it was not the force of the annointing with oyle, but the efficacie of the prayer of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:181128:72"/>faith that ſhould ſaue the ſicke, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought now only to be vſed both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely and priuately without others.</p>
               <p>And againe, laſtly the Apoſtle in thoſe words, in the name of the Lord, ſetteth not the forme of this their Sacrament, as <hi>Beliarmine</hi> will haue it, but onely giueth al Chriſtians a prouiſo, how they ought to pray, that is not to vſe any Diueliſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, Magicall charmes, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lolatricall inuocations, as doth <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo giue the like caueat vnto them,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note> vnto whom he writeth in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion of this his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, when he ſaith: <hi>Babes, take heed of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols;</hi> that is, from all idolatrous worſhip, ſeruice and inuocation, but faithfully to call vpon the name of the Lord,<note place="margin">Iohn 1.5. 12.</note> euen the Lord onely who he ſaith in the next verſe 16. can and will raiſe vp the ſicke. And thus much of their extreame vnction how farre it differeth from our ointment in this place.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:181128:82"/>yea and Chriſt himſelfe is ſaid by the Apoſtles, not to be ſeene of Angels, but after a while, euen after his manifeſtation or incarnation in the fleſh, and then iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſpirit, then ſeene of Augels, &amp;c. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.

Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how could theſe men know all things, when as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that our knowledge is vnperfect, and that we know but in part now, that is in the world; but that then, that is hereafter, in the life to come, wee ſhall know euen as we are knowne, 1. <hi>Cor:</hi> 13.12. And againe, the ſame Apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the ſame Epiſtle ſaith, <hi>That if any man thinke that he knoweth any thing,</hi>

What then ſhall we ſay to all this? Euen briefly, and in a word, thus: That for the knowledge they had, and for all thoſe things they knewe, of which noe doubt they had a great meaſure, by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the annointing which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, they did not knowe the ſame of themſelues as of their owne wit, labour, induſtrie, deſert, or dignitie, but that they were endued therewith, by the gift and grace of the holy Ghoſt; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were humbly, and thankfully to referre and reſigne all their vnderſtanding vnto the ſpirit of God, by whoſe bleſſing they had receiued the ſame; or els thus, all thoſe things which they knew, were neither erronious lies, nor falſe fables, nor humane precepts, nor vnwritten verities, nor doubtfull dreames, but the ſound and holeſome, ſyncere, &amp; holy truth of Chriſts Goſpell, infuſed in their ſoules, by the ſweet influence of this precious ointment, and inſtilled into their hearts by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly dewe of diuine grace. Or againe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:181128:83"/>thus, that indeed they perfectly knew all thoſe things, that were neceſſarie vnto their ſoules health and ſaluation; that is, Chriſt and him crucified, Ieſus and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, which was ſo ſufficient for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as that they needed no other ſecular know ledge or carnall wiſedome, of any humane and prophane Artes, and ſciences whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer; for as a learned writer ſaith, The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle writeth not here vnto theſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <hi>Adulatoriè tanquam ad elementarios,</hi> as flatteringly, to ſoothe &amp; ſmoothe them vp in their infancie and ignorance, for he oftentimes tearmeth them babes, not as carnall or as babes in Chriſt, but as ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall; not ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, 1. Epiſt. 3.1.2. to whom he gaue milke to drinke, and not meat to eate, but ſuch as he would haue had the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.20.</note> not children in malitiouſnes, but in vnderſtanding, of ripe age, nor yet vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloriouſly to vaunt or boaſt himſelfe of them being their Doctor, as a bragging ſchoolemaſter of his good ſchollers, that profit vnderneath him, becauſe afterwards verſe 27. that they had no need that anie ſhould teach them, for he arrogateth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnto himſelfe, but attributeth all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:181128:83"/>to Chriſt Ieſus, when as he telleth them as it is in my text, that they haue knowne all things, not by his inſtruction, but by the vnction of him that is holy. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo in the 27. ver. he ſaith againe, that the annointing that they had receiued, and dwelled in them, did teach them all things. Neither is this to be meruailed at, that they ſhould be ſaid of our Apoſtle to haue knowne all things, when as they knew but Chriſt onely, and thoſe things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the common ſaluation, which to know was all ſufficient for them, &amp; would alone without any ſupply of other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whatſoeuer, bring them to eternall life. For ſo our Sauiour, <hi>This is life eternal euen to know thee to be the onely true God, and him whom thou haſt ſent, Chriſt Ieſus, Ioh.</hi> 17.3. And therfore <hi>Paul</hi> ingenuouſly profeſſeth no other knowledge, although he did abound in all humane learning, and that with a proteſtation, ſaying: <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, that I ſhould reioice in any thing, but in Chriſt and him crucified:</hi> for as Chriſt the onely holy one, is the ſcope of all the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both being the complement of the Lawe, and the intendiment of the Goſpel So to knowe him, is to know all things,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:181128:84"/>whatſoeuer Scripture can teach vs, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can tell vs; wherewith God will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten vs, or man can learne vs. So that in this reſpect, are thoſe two olde Prouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biall verſes found true,

                  </q> As for the ſecular knowledge of other worldly things, it is either ſuperfluous or ſuperſtitious, vanitie, or curioſitie, ſuch as a Chriſtian man may well be without, and the want whereof, will not make him the more godly learned: for as <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaith, there is <hi>Docta ignorantia,</hi>

Fourthly Turkes and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens, to whom this truth is a fable. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Heretikes, to whom this doctrine is nothing els but errour and falſhood. As
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:181128:94"/>namely, of the Martionites, that denie Chriſt to be manifeſted in the fleſh; of the Arrians, that denie him to be iuſtified in the ſpirit; of the Saduces, that ſay there are no Angels nor ſpirits: and therefore that Chriſt could not be ſeene of Angels. As alſo ſome Infidels, who neuer yet heard of Chriſt: and likewiſe many worldlings, which neuer as yet beleeued on Chriſt. And laſtly of the Apellites, Chriſtolites, and Carpocratians, which gainſay Chriſt to haue been taken vp, and aſcended into heauen, but onely his Godhead and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie; and if any part of his humanitie and manhood, then his ſoule onely, and not this body, which they affirme to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued into the foure Elements: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not this Scripture, nor no part thereof to be without controuerſie. It may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe that wrote this, was the faithfull ſeruant of God; and as <hi>Timothy</hi> to whom this was written, was likewiſe a faithfull Paſtour of the Church; euen ſo that the Apoſtle doth auerre and auouch this in the perſon and behalfe of al the faithfull; the children of God, the members of Chriſt, the conuerts to the Goſpell, the numberof the elect, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:181128:94"/>of the truth, the beleeuing bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as otherwiſe, not regarding and neglecting the crooked and corrupt iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, and the contrarie opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the faithleſſe, which are alients and ſtrangers from the commonwealth of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell, as being without God in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who by reaſon of their ignorance doe dwell in darkeneſſe, blunder in blindneſſe, and grope as it were at noone day, which neither care to learne nor can beleeue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their diſobedience; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore caſting them off, as it were in a reprobate ſence. For according to the Philoſopher, <hi>There is no reaſoning with them that denie the principles of Arte;</hi> ſo there is no teaching of them that gainſay the Articles of our faith. But as hee alſo ſaieth concerning the humane ſciences, <hi>Oportet addiſcentem credere;</hi> that is, <hi>He that will learne, he muſt beleeue.</hi> So in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or fundamentall points of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it is firſt requiſite and neceſſarie, that a Chriſtian man bee fully reſolued, that they are true before he be inſtructed in them. And ſo no doubt are all the good and the godly, the elect and the faithfull, thoroughtly perſwaded of the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:181128:95"/>of God, giuen by diuine inſpiration, that it is moſt certaine and true, and euerie part and parcell thereof; and therefore do giue their aſſent and conſent thereunto, not onely with their heart beleeuing it, but with their mouth confeſſing it, with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe profeſſing it, with zeale proteſting it, and finally with their liues witneſſing it, becomming not onely belecuers, but alſo confeſſors and Martyrs of the ſame. So that our Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> might ſay ſafely and ſoothly, writing vnto ſuch in way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, to prepare them to attention and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and without all contenrion, and to put them in minde of that wherein they before had been inſtructed and informed. <hi>Without contrcuerſie,</hi> as being a matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue opinion without preiudice, and paſt all peraduenture, as containing nothing els in it, but demonſtrations in Diuinitie.

This made <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt great, as the Angell foretolde, that he ſhould be great in the ſight of the Lord, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.15. and not onely great, but the greateſt Prophet that was borne of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. And yet ſuch and ſo great is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this miſterie, that it maketh him that is the leaſt in the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to bee greater then he, 7.28. This made <hi>Marie</hi> great, as ſhe confeſſeth her ſelfe ſaying, <hi>he that is mighty hath magnified
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:181128:110"/>me;</hi> and therefore her ſoule magnified the Lord, as it is in her Magnificat, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. Is this myſterie then of Godlineſſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either generally or particularly? Great that we may adde an edge to that which hath been ſpoken, great, in reſpect of the ſoueraigne Author thereof, which is God, great, in regard of the ſubiect matter ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the word and will of God; finally great in reſpect of the ſoule ſauing effect therof, to be great in the kingdome of heauen. Then if thou wouldeſt be brought to God, if thou care for thine owne ſaluation, it thou deſire euerlaſting bliſſe; renownce all other falſe religions, forſake all other vain profeſſions, make account of no other fond myſterie: there is but one way without wandring, and that is Chriſt; but one ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie without errour, and that is the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; but one life without death, and that is in heauen. This great myſterie in this text is that life, this truth is that veritie, and this Godlineſſe is that way, <hi>Haec via ſine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uio, haec veritas ſine dubio, hac vita ſine taedio,</hi> as ſaith a learned Father. To this myſterie let all new inuentions, vnwritten verities and humane doctrines giue place; the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala of the Iews, the Alcaron of the Turke,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:181128:110"/>the obſcurities of the Gnoſticks, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundities of the Valentinians, the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Cathariſts, and the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Catholiks; all which muſt needs vaniſh away as the miſtie cloudes before the ſunne, and be ſcattered as the duſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the winde, and finally be conſumed as the rods of the charmers of Egypt by <hi>Aarons</hi> Rodde: euen as all the Oracles of the Heathen ceaſed at the comming of Chriſt, and all the religions were put to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence by the preaching of the Goſpell, and the euill ſpir its of Sathan which poſſeſſed men, were throwne out by the power of the ſpirit of the holy Ghoſt — To this religion therefore only ought all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full chriſtians to giue their aſſent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which no Tyrant could euer extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, were he neuer ſo mightie or maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor hereticke confute, were he neuer ſo learned or ſubtile, nor anie enemy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, were he neuer ſo powerfull or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke: which may be for a time yclouded or ecclipſed, but ſhall neuer wholy looſe her light, and preſſed and depreſſed for a while, but ſhall neuer finally be oppreſſed; and laſtly may be aſſailed and aſſaulted, but neuer vtterly vanquiſhed.

               <p>Thus much of this great myſterie of truth or godlineſſe, as it is here generally defined of the Apoſtle; now of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular parcels and branches thereof in their due order.

So that as he was borne without Carnall copulation, ſo was he brought forth with out mortall corruption. And as he was firſt borne of his Father before al worldes without a mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, and did create the world; ſo ſecondly was he borne of his mother in the world without a father, that he might conſecrate by his deuine Maieſtie inuiſible, by his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine birth viſible in them, both wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, of the one as impoſſible to be expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith, <hi>And who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his generation?

This foure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by woman alone without man, a new thing, a ſtrang matter, a wonderfull mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, neuer the like ſeene nor hard of before. Yea ſuch a marueile, as that the reporte
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:181128:115"/>of it made an infant to skippe in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe for Ioye, the Heauens to ſpeake by a ſtarre to declare the wonder of it, the wiſe men from the Eaſt to come from farre to ſee and be eyewitneſſes of it, the Angels to ſinge in the Conſort, and to ſhew fourth their gladneſſe after it was made knowne vnto them, The ſheaphards of Bethlem to runne in haſt to behould it, after it was declared vnto them, the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent father Simeon, to deſire to die and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte in peace after he had ſeene his ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Finally, this made the ould Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe <hi>Anna,</hi> when as by the motion of the ſpirit this thing was reueled vnto her, to leaue her prayer to God, and to fal to prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Lord Chriſt, and from faſting, to come not only to confeſſe him her ſelfe, but alſo to commend him vnto other. And ſuch a miſterie, as none was thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be meſſenger of the ſame, not a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preiſt nor a deuine <hi>Frophet,</hi> nor a greate <hi>Patriarch,</hi> but an holy Angell and Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel euen <hi>Gabriell</hi> that ſtandeth in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God. Whoſe countenance being terrible, his garments glorious, and his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming ſodaine, in viſiting the virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, he troubled her, and yet his voice being
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:181128:115"/>pleaſant, his words ſweete, and his tydings gladſome, in ſaluting her comforted her; telling her that as ſhe was the beloued vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of God, and handmaide of God, ſo ſhe ſhould be the bleſſed mother of God, and ſpouſe of God. And ſuch a miracle, as whereby the word did not periſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned into fleaſh, but fleaſh leaſt it ſhould periſh cleauing to the word; that as man is both ſoule and bodie, ſo Chriſt might be both God, and man; not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of nature, but by vnitie of perſon, and this conceaued and perceaued not with the Eies of the fleaſh, but with the faith of the harte, the only begotten and the firſt begotten of his Father, and the firſt begotten of his bretheren lying in a manger, &amp; filling the whole world, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in ſwadling clothes, and thundering in the Cloudes; ſucking on earth the pappes of his mother, and yet ſitting in Heauen at the right hand of God his Father; and is finally ſuch a greate myſterie as that it compriſeth the principall Pillour of our faith, the moſt certaine grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of truth, the ſtrongeſt fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of the Church: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are to conſider firſt, the vnſpeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loue of God the father towards vs,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:181128:116"/>who would not ſpare his owne and only ſonne, but freely gaue him to ſaue vs. And our Sauiour in the goſpell, <hi>God ſo loued the world, that he gaue his only begotten ſonne, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly his owne incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loue in ſhewing himſelfe ſo kinde and courteous vnto mankind as to ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be caſt in his mould, to be clothed with his fleaſh, &amp; to be compaſſed about his infirmities which he himſelfe commen deth, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15.13.

Here then firſt we are to know for our inſtruction the two natures of Chriſt, ſecondlie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of both his natures,<note place="margin">2 natures of Chriſt.</note> as firſt his diuinitie, in that the Apoſtle calleth him God,<note place="margin">Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions.</note> and then his humanitie in affirming him to be manifeſted in the fleaſh, Thirdly
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:181128:116"/>the <hi>Hipoſtaticall</hi> vnion and communitie of of properties in one &amp; the ſame perſonne of our Sauiour, three deepe miſteries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and couched in three words <hi>in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> ſaieth <hi>Beza</hi> verie briefly <hi>duae ponuntur, diſtinguntur, vniuntur naturae Chriſti</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by three ſorts of Hereſies are confuted.

Secondly we are to learne for our edification, that we may make vſe and take proffit in our life and conuerſation by this miſterie, euen three thinges <hi>Auſtin</hi> comprehendeth them together in one ſweete ſentence, Ser. 22.<note place="margin">3 things to be lerned by this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie.</note>

Thus much of theſe words, as hauing a general vew of them, but now let vs ſift the ſame more narrowly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſider them not in waie of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſcourſe, but in manner of a ſhort ſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uey as firſt to declare what manifeſtation this was, and ſecondly the forme thereof.

But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt Ieſus, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was thus mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in our fleſh, he tooke it not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him for a time, but perpetually, euen to be our eternall mediatour both God and man
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:181128:118"/>world without end, and to continewe a preiſt for euer, after the order of Melcheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decke. And here we are to note, how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Apoſtle writeth, when he here ſetteth downe, that God, was manifeſted in the fleaſh, and not the Godhead, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as the logitians ſay in the <hi>contract</hi> but not in the <hi>Abſtract,</hi> being true in the one, as appeareth, but not in the other, as in the <hi>Contract</hi> becauſe it containeth in it the whole perſon of Chriſt, conſiſting of both natures, but not in the <hi>Abſtract,</hi> for that it conſidereth the ſeuerall nature of his diuinitie only, which in noe wiſe can be manifeſted in the fleaſh, nor be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with his humanitie, vnleſſe we will runne into <hi>Eutiches</hi> errour, and thinke that his manhood was not taken only but alſo abſorpt and conſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of his Godhead, which is a foule Hereſie: ſo that it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth euidently, what maner, of manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this was.</p>
               <p>Now therefore only in a word or two, lette vs ſpeake of the forme it ſelfe, into which god is here ſaid to be manifeſted, &amp; ſo to paſſe on to the nexte branche of this miſterie; becauſe we haue dwelt verie lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in this alreadie which forme is here ſaid to

As that which was immortall, inuiſible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible and infinite, ſhould take vnto it a kind of nature, which was mortal uiſible, comprehenſible, and finite, yea which might be ſeene, touched, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and like vnto vs in all reſpects, ſinne on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly excepted; not by conuerting the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in to manhood, but by conioyning the humaine nature to the diuine, vniting them both in one perſon of Chriſt our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, euen as <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1.1. witneſſeth <hi>that which we haue hard, that which we haue ſeen which we haue looked vpon, &amp; our hands haue handled of the word of life,</hi> neither tooke he any other fourme either of any Creature vpon the earth, or of any power in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> noe not of any Angell, but of the ſeede of <hi>Abraham</hi> onely, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. And why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as the Apoſtle in the ſame chapter rendreth the Reaſon, for as much as the children were partakers of fleſh &amp; bloud, he alſo himſelfe tooke likewiſe parte with them <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14 Here then fleſh is not taken for the naturall vitiouſneſſe of mans corruption, as it is often times taken in the ſcriptures, eſpecially in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes</hi> for the vnregenerate parte of man
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:181128:119"/>contrarie vnto the ſpirit, for then ſhould our Sauiour Chriſt be ſubiect vnto ſinne, as we are, which were blaſphemie to affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, but for the whole naturall and true eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and ſubſtance of a mortal man, both of reaſonable ſoule and of humaine fleaſh ſubſiſting, and not of body only, leaſt we fall into the Erronious opinion of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollinariſts.</hi> And thus much of this maine branche of this greate miſterie: now of the nexte.</p>

Euen firſt manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſecondly iuſtified, and thirdly ſeene, &amp; fourthly preached. As greate a worke of wonder as any of the reſt in all reſpectes, firſt for the perſon, ſo baſe, ſo vile, ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a man, the ſonne of man, &amp; a worme and noe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be proclamed a ſoueraigne ſauiour, an heauenly king, an omnipotent God, incredible to be beleeued, impoſſible
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:181128:129"/>to be perfourmed in the eyes of fleaſh and blood, that a woorme ſhould ſaue al men that the ſeede of a woman ſhould bruſe a ſerpents heade, that the dewe of the birth which was of the wombe of the morning, ſhould droune the greate <hi>Leuiathan</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all his dragons in the redde ſea: intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be ſuffered in policie, for the greate ſtates and potentates of the world, for a poore babe, who was faine to haue an Inne for his lodging, a ſtable for his chamber, &amp; a cracth or manger for his cradle, to be wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhipped of honorable eſtates, haue offered vnto him gould, mirrhe and franken cenſe, in ſignes and ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his three fould office, that he was a royall kinge, an holie Preiſt, and an annointed prophet, yea for a carpenter, or carpenters ſonne as he was commonly called, and accompted, to be ſoueraigne monarch of all the kinges, key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, and conquerours of the earth. And iniurious to be borne with in pietie as it ſhould ſeeme, for a baſe Nazarite and a rude Galelea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to deface <hi>Moyſes,</hi> &amp; diſgrace God, to abrogate the Law, aboliſh the ordinances, to fruſtrate circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſition and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate former cerimonies, as the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded Iewes did obiect againſt him.

All theſe thinges were not only maruelous, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo odious and dangerous, in reſpect of his perſon, and therefore a deepe point of this miſterie of godlineſſe.

Againe; for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this preaching contemned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of all men, becauſe it was not only bare and naked without a ſigne to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and confirme it, and therfore a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to the <hi>Iewes;</hi> but alſo plaine and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without wiſdome of words to ſhew &amp; ſetit fourth, and therefore folly to the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.2.

Notwithſtanding all which, ſee the miſterie, beholde the wonder, how this is brought to paſſe: for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though a vile woorme, yet a glorious Archangell or Prince of angelles, thought a meane mortall man, yet a mightie and immortall God, though a ſon borne and a child giuen, yet an euerlaſting father, and the auncient of daies. Secondly for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, though folly to men, yet the wiſdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of God, though an offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce both to the Iewes and Gentiles, yet the power of God vnto ſaluation, to the Iewes firſt, and alſo to the Gentiles though a ſtumblinge blocke, yet a ſweete baite, whereby many ſoules were caught by the hookes of the Goſpell. And for the preachers though poore fiſher men
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:181128:131"/>yet powrfull fiſhers of men, though rude Galileans, yet honorable Apoſtles, though not puffed vp with humaine knowledge, yet inſpired with heauenly wiſedome. And finally the perſons that were preached vnto though Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles by generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet Iſraelites, by regeneration: though children of truth, yet of ſtones made the ſonnes of <hi>Abraha</hi> though aliants and ſtrangers from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But who preached not the workes of God by the creation of the world, although they after a ſorte doe make manifeſt that, which may be knowne of God; they viſible, ſhewing the inuiſible thinges of him, that is his eternall power and godhead <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19.20. and albeit as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith <hi>The heauens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glorie of god &amp; the firmament ſhew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth forth his handie workes Pſal.</hi> 19.1: For theſe were but dumbe teachers, and the text &amp; intendiment of there teaching was only this, that there was a God that made the world.

So that hauing before ſaid, that theſe Scribes and Phariſes, did far otherwiſe leade their liues, then they did teach and preach; now he addeth for the more certaintie and aſſurance of that which he affirmed before, that if they had any good thing in them at all in ſhow and in ſemblance, that the ſame was altogether
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:181128:144"/>vaine and trifeling, falſe and fained, becauſe they had noe other thing in their purpoſe and intente, but palpably to pleaſe men &amp; as it here appeareth to ſet out and ſhew forth themſelues. Theſe Scribes therefore and Phariſes did either moſt manifeſtly tranſgreſſe the Law of God, or els did ſo notoriouſly diſſemble, that they ſeemed to be altogether honeſt and holy, when they were nothing ſo nor ſo, hauing a foule vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage vnder a faire viſarde, for as all is not gould that gliſtereth, ſo all are not perfect that appeare ſo, nor all good and godly, that giue an outward gloſſe of integritie, and ſanctimonie.

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:181128:144"/>according to euerie wind.

And is indeede the mother of aduice, as in this place it hath twined and twiſted with it Ambition a bird of the ſame feather, and a ſinne of the ſame ſtampe.

And here is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprehended the Ambition in theſe Scribes and Phariſes with the which they were much tainted and infected; But when as our Sauiour had vtterly condemned the breach of the lawe of God in their whole life and conuerſation, leaſt they ſhould obiect and alledge for their excuſe as a buckler or defence their fained holineſſe, by a Preoccupation he preuenting them anſwereth: that they are but triffles, traſhe, and trumperie, yea and verie vanitie, of which they doe boaſt and bragge, meere oſtentation raigning, and ruling in them; whereas If their holineſſe were ſincere, they would not ſeeke for the rewarde and regarde of mortall men: for as the Poet ſaith, <hi>Ipſa quidem virtus ſibimet pulcherrima merces:</hi> and if they would needes gape af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

As our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the 6. of <hi>Math.</hi> here and els were teſtifieth, who did not only ſee their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde deeds as an eie witnes thereof, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuerſant among them, but did alſo know their inward hartes, being the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the reines, <hi>ſaying they gaue their almes before men, to be ſeene and praiſed of men, and cauſed a trumpet to be blowne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, like Hypocrites in their ſinagogues and in the ſtreets.</hi> And againe, when they ſtoode praying in their ſinagogues and in the corners of the ſtreets to be behoulden of men, vſing Polulogies and Battologies that is vaine repetions, &amp; much babblings, for which as our Sauiour here telleth, they had the guerdon and reward they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and looked for, that is the vaine praiſe and commendation of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Moreouer when they faſted, they like Hypocrites looked ſowerly, and. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured their countenance, that they might ſeeme vnto men to faſt; euen as the Heyre is ſaid to weepe at the death of his father. As it is in the Prouerb. <hi>Haeredis luctus ſub larua, riſus eſt.</hi> As it appeareth

And againe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring widdowes howſes vnder a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of long prayers, as it is in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

And therefore are likened of our ſauiour (and that worthely) to whited tombes, which appeare beautifull outward, but within are full of deade mens boanes and all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, they appearing outwardly Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before men, but within full of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and iniquitie. So that we ſee theſe words moſt fully confirmed vnto vs, that horrible vice did raigne and rule in thoſe Scribes and phariſies, and noe maruaile, for a learned writer ſaith. <hi>
